## 1. Introduction

**Mystery Inc** (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates spooky investigations and general meddling-in-mysteries operations. This page outlines our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you hire us to solve ghostly goings-on — or submit a mystery online — and the rights you have regarding that data.

No spectral nonsense — just transparency.

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing

We process your data based on:

- **Contract Performance**: You’ve asked us to bust a ghost — we need data to do it
- **Legal Obligations**: Like keeping records of unmasked villains
- **Legitimate Interests**: To keep improving Mystery Inc
- **Consent**: Where explicitly given — like for Scooby Cam access

---

## 6. Data Retention

We keep your data just long enough to wrap up the mystery (or series of mysteries).

- **Account data**: While your account is active
- **Mystery files**: Until you delete them or we archive the case
- **Payment records**: As required by law (10 years, even for cursed gold transactions)

---

## 7. Your Data Protection Rights

You have the following rights under data protection laws — and we don’t need Velma’s glasses to read them:

- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate details
- Delete your data ("Right to be forgotten — like old villains in costumes")
- Restrict processing
- Port your data elsewhere
- Object to data usage
- Withdraw consent (any time, no spooky strings attached)

Contact us at `contact@mysteryinc.com` to exercise these rights.

---

## 8. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We share your data with only the most trusted and non-haunted partners:

- **Stripe** – for safe, secure payment processing
- **OpenAI** – for ghost summary analysis and spooky report generation

All third parties are bound by data protection agreements (and trap clauses).

---

## 9. International Data Transfers

Your data may travel across borders like a traveling ghost show. But don’t worry — we have safeguards:

- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Adequacy decisions where applicable
- Secure transfer methods approved by data protection authorities

---

## 10. Cookies and Tracking

We don’t use cookies. No tracking ghosts. No invisible scripts.

We rely on **standard authentication tokens** for session security — like Scooby Snacks, they disappear when you leave.

---

## 11. Data Security

We implement the following anti-creep-measures:

- Regular ghost-proof security audits
- Strong encryption spells
- Access restrictions (only team members can see clues)
- Staff trained in “Scooby-Do(o) Data Protection 101”

---

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy when mystery-solving techniques evolve. We’ll post changes right here and update the "Last updated" date at the top.

You should check this page once in a while — even if you're not haunted.

## 13. Contact Us
