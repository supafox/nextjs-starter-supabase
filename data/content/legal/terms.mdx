- Paranormal consultation

Operations are based in Coolsville, USA, and governed by U.S. law.

## 3. Contract Formation

By requesting a mystery investigation, you enter into a legally binding agreement with Mystery Inc. The contract is finalized when you receive our email (or owl-delivered letter, depending on location and signal strength).

---

## 4. User Account and Data Protection

Creating a user account may be required for certain services. You agree to:

- Provide truthful information (no fake ghost aliases)
- Keep your account details safe
- Not let ghosts, goblins, or even Shaggy access your account credentials

---

## 5. Prices and Payment Terms

- All prices are listed in USD.
- Payment is due at the time of booking unless otherwise agreed upon.
- Prices may vary depending on the size of the haunted premises, trap complexity, and snack availability.

Additional charges may apply for:

- Real supernatural entities
- Excess slime cleanup
- Scooby-Doo’s “emergency snack fund”
- Shaggy’s therapy sessions post-haunting

---

## 6. Right of Withdrawal and Withdrawal Form

You have the right to cancel your mystery request within 14 days of confirmation, as long as the mystery hasn’t already started or no one has been chased down a hallway.

## 7. Dispute Resolution

We prefer to resolve all disputes over a campfire with marshmallows. However, if needed, standard U.S. consumer protection channels are available.

---

## 8. Governing Law

All services and agreements are governed by the laws of the United States. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply—especially because we don’t export trapdoors internationally.

---

## 9. Service Usage and Limitations

You agree to use Mystery Inc’s services responsibly:

- Don’t call us for non-spooky things (like locating lost socks).
- Understand that we cannot guarantee 100% ghost removal.
- We may refuse service if the mystery is clearly a hoax, already solved, or boring.

We reserve the right to cancel a service if:

- Velma loses her glasses again
- Fred gets overly excited about trap design
- The mystery has already been solved by a local librarian

---

## 10. Disclaimer of Liability

To the maximum extent allowed by law:

- Our services are provided “AS IS,” often with dramatic chase scenes.
- We disclaim liability for:
  - Emotional trauma from finding out the ghost was your uncle
  - Minor property damage from impromptu trap testing
  - Consumption of your entire snack stash
  - Unexpected monster selfies in your photo roll

Total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the current mystery investigation or the equivalent of three boxes of Scooby Snacks, whichever is lower.

---

## 11. Intellectual Property

All Mystery Inc methods, trap designs, ghost detection gear, and catchphrases are the exclusive property of Mystery Inc.

You may not:

- Recreate our patented Ghost Net 3000™
- Record our mysteries for commercial broadcast without consent
- Use our likenesses in unauthorized action figures

---

## 12. Security

All payments are securely processed via **Stripe**. Your payment data is never stored by Mystery Inc, not even in the back of the Mystery Machine.

- Stripe uses end-to-end encryption and is PCI Level 1 compliant.
- For more info, see [Stripe's Security Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/security).

By using our services, you agree to these terms and acknowledge that the call might end in someone yelling “And I would’ve gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids!”
